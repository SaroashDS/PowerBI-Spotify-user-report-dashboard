## Problem Statement

This dashboard aims to provide comprehensive insights into music streaming data, enabling users to analyze track popularity, artist performance, and user preferences in a visually appealing manner. This can be really user for people who listen to music all the time.


### Steps followed 
1. Objective Definition:
   - Develop a detailed music streaming dashboard for data-driven decision-making in the music industry.
2. Data Collection:
   - Gathered data on track names, artists, release dates, and stream counts from a latest kaggle dataset.
3. Data Preparation:
   - Cleaned and formatted the data for analysis, addressing any missing or inconsistent values. Renamed the columns.
   - Used spotify API to fetch the song cover photos utilizing python script (song_fetch.py). The urls were then added to the dataset
4. Dashboard Design:
   - Key Metrics:
       = Total Streams: Represents the overall stream count.
       = Top Song vs. Average: Compares the streams of the top song against the average streams.
   - Visualizations:
        1. Bar Chart (Top Tracks):
        
              - X-Axis: Track names
              - Y-Axis: Stream counts
              - Insight: Visual representation of top tracks and their popularity.
         
        2. Line Chart (Stream Trend):
        
              - X-Axis: Release dates
              - Y-Axis: Stream counts
              - Insight: Depicts the trend in streaming over time.
        3. Heat Map (Energy Distribution):
        
              - X-Axis: Energy levels
              - Y-Axis: Stream counts
              - Insight: Highlights the distribution of energy levels across tracks.
        4. KPI Cards:
        
              - Average Streams: Displays the average stream count.
              - Top Song Streams: Displays stream count for the top song.
              - Top Artist Streams: Displays stream count for the top artist.
5. DAX Measures:
   1.  Top Song Streams:
       - Calculates the stream count for the top song.
        ```DAX
        Top Song Streams = CALCULATE(SUM('MusicData'[StreamCount]), TOPN(1, 'MusicData', 'MusicData'[StreamCount], DESC))
        ```
   2.  Average Streams:
       - Computes the average stream count.
        ```DAX
        Average Streams = AVERAGE('MusicData'[StreamCount])
        ```
   3.  Top Artist Streams:
       - Determines the stream count for the top artist.
        ```DAX
        Top Artist Streams = CALCULATE(SUM('MusicData'[StreamCount]), TOPN(1, VALUES('MusicData'[Artist]), 'MusicData'[StreamCount], DESC))
        ```
   4.  Energy Range:
       - Groups tracks into energy ranges for the heat map.
        ```DAX
        Energy Range = SWITCH(TRUE(), 'MusicData'[Energy] < 0.25, "Low", 'MusicData'[Energy] >= 0.25 && 'MusicData'[Energy] < 0.75, "Medium", 'MusicData'[Energy] >= 0.75, "High")
        ```
   5.  Max Streams:
       - Finds the maximum stream count.
        ```DAX
        Max Streams = CALCULATE(MAX('MusicData'[StreamCount]))
        ```  
6.Visual Enhancements:
 - Adjusted chart sizes, colors, and labels for improved readability.
 - Customized themes to match the aesthetics of the music streaming industry.
 - The hex codes for spotify theme were grabbed from https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/53188

 - Step 16 : New measure was created to find  % of customers,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of customers,
 
         % Customers = (DIVIDE(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Count of Customers], 129880)*100)
 
 A card visual was used to represent this perecntage.
 
 Snap of % of customers who preferred business class

 - Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate total distance travelled by flights & a card visual was used to represent total distance.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total distance,
 
         Total Distance Travelled = SUM(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Flight Distance])
    
 A card visual was used to represent this total distance.

 - Step 18 : The report was then published to Power BI Service.
